# Module 5 - Kilowatthours

# TASK DESCRIPTION
# Prepare a function that based on working time, quantity
# consumed kilowatt-hours will answer how much I will pay for electricity, which
# consumes the device. The default cost of 1 kWh is 0.617

# Import libraries

# Welcome message

# Get data from user

# Testing data
# g_working_time = 12
# g_device_power = 0.6
# print(f'\nProgram will calculate cost device with power = {g_device_power} kW generates in {g_working_time} h.')
